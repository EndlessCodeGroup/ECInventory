**EC Inventory** is a rethinking of RPGInventory idea with a focus on **stability** and **inventory features**.

> :construction: **WORK IN PROGRESS**

Unlike RPGInventory, **ECInventory** is:

- Focused on inventory-related features and will not provide functionality like pets, custom items, craft extensions and so on
- Provides the possibility to create multiple inventories per player
- Will give you control not only on custom inventories but on vanilla inventory too
- Will provide API for programmatic inventories building
